One of my favorite professors in music school’s most common greeting was “How’s your career?”. At the time I didn’t think much of it. This lack of thought about career planning was a common theme throughout my college and post-college years. Part of this was by design&mdash;I studied music composition in college because that was what interested me most, not to get me a job, and fell into the career of performing on cruise ships because I had enjoyed playing jazz gigs for extra money while in school and I couldn’t think of anything better to do. After purposely switching to study software development, I feel like I am actually planning and controlling my career for the first time.

To be fair to my earlier self though, you can’t really plan a music career. The best way to get ahead in that field is just to accept every opportunity that presents itself to you, even if it seems like a bad idea at the time, and be at the right place at the right time. That I think is the best description out of any as why music is a limited and dead-end career in the 21st century.

Now that I actually have a choice in career planning, I think about it all the time. The choice of languages, the choice of platforms for projects are always taken into the account in the perspective of future job prospects and how it will affect my career path later on. Instead of taking jobs for a quick buck I think of how it will look on my resume and the story I want to be able to tell and the things I want to learn.

Another thing I think about is that many students just starting out want to know what language and what platform (web, mobile, enterprise, etc) will earn them the most money. The thing that software developers have in their favor is that they all make money, so the important thing is to find what you want to do most and pursue that. This is a stark contrast music, where you always have to find out what people like and what styles of music and what songs are most popular, or you risk not getting hired, or not getting paid.

So my career advice is to find out what you like and always think about how you can remain doing it.
