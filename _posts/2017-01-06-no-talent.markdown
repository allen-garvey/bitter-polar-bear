Coming from the music and art world, the word "talented" has always rubbed me the wrong way. When it's used to describe a person or their achievements, it makes me think that the person describing their skill means that it is innate to their person, rather than something they worked long and hard to acquire. While in some cases this might be accurate, such as when talking about rare prodigies and savants, I think it does a disservice both to the person you are describing, and the audience that you are trying to connect with. As detailed in the [10,000 hour rule](https://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017930/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483761877&sr=8-1&keywords=outliers) or [Talent Is Overrated,](https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842948/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1483761885&sr=8-1&keywords=talent+is+overrated) it takes many hours of practice to achieve a level that anybody would be impressed by. By hiding this behind a word like "talented", it diminishes this labor, and makes their efforts seem impossible to other people. So the next time you hear someone described as "talented", change it in your mind to "worked very hard".
