Recently, I read an article that said that [50% of people do zero searches a day on Google.](https://theoverspill.wordpress.com/2015/10/19/searches-average-mobile-google-problem/) This obviously poses a huge problem for Google, as more people use mobile devices than desktops for web browsing, and the numbers are only going to rise as time goes on. I got to thinking about possible solutions that Google might attempt.

What I found interesting is that despite Google’s huge userbase in Youtube, Android and ChromeOS, the majority of their profits still come from advertisements in search. While thinking of a natural next step for Google, I finally came to the conclusion that a natural outgrowth of their expertise in search and machine learning is a Google Recommendation Engine.
While it’s easier than ever to find whatever we want, it still hard to know what we should be looking for in the first place. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just ask Google what book or movie you should check out next, or what new game or app you would just love? Coincidentally, David Foster Wallace, who was always so prescient about the consequences of consumerism, had some of the same ideas. From his interview with David Lipsky in [Although Of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself](http://www.amazon.com/Although-Course-You-Becoming-Yourself-ebook/dp/B0036S4DYM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447043501&sr=1-1&keywords=in+the+end+you+become+yourself) he says,

> “If you go back to Hobbes, and why we ended up begging, why people in a state of nature end up begging for a ruler who has the power of life and death over them? We absolutely have to give our power away. The Internet is going to be exactly the same way. Unless there are walls and sites and gatekeepers that say, ‘All right, you want some fairly good fiction on the Web? Let us pick it for you.’ Because it’s gonna take you four days to find something any good, through all the shit that’s gonna come, right? We’re gonna beg for it. We are literally going to pay for it. But once we do that, then all these democratic hoo-hah dreams of the Internet will of course have gone down the pipes.”

I find this quote incredibly prophetic because while it’s all the way back from 1996 when the internet was just starting to become popular, it describes in great detail things that are just starting to happen today, such as Apple News.
