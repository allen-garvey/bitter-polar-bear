One of the things that I've had to adjust to with becoming a professional software developer has been working as part of a team. This was a change for me because while studying computer science at community college all our projects were (rightly) done solo, which made sense because they all had to be done in a week and were too small in scope for more than one person. My personal projects as well were all done by just me, and I had become accustomed to having to do everything myself. That being said, after working as part of a team now for several months, I greatly enjoy it, much more than working alone. Here are some of the benefits I've noticed.

## Splitting Up Work

When you work by yourself, you have to do everything yourself, which means that if you don't do something, it doesn't get done. When you have a team, you might be surprised some days to see that something has been added or fixed while you were working on something else. Teams also allow you to divide up work to match people's strengths or preferences. There was one day when the two things that needed to be done were to create an email template and add a modal dialog to a site. I was dreading making the email template, and a co-worker didn't want to create the modal dialog, so we traded projects and were both happy at work that day.

## Communication

While having to always let your team know what you're working on all the time can be a negative, as it can slow down your productivity, I've found it can also be a positive. When you have to explain what you're doing to someone else, it can help you clarify to yourself what you need to do. If your explanation is complicated or unclear, that means you don't really understand what you need to do. Co-workers can also then offer suggestions or clarifications that can be very helpful and save you hours of work. These improvements might never have been received or thought of independently if you had just kept your head down and done your work without talking to anyone. Brainstorming or just talking about the product in a general way are also great sources of new features and future improvements. Talking with co-workers also allows a nice time to recharge from coding while still being helpful to the task of improving the product.

## Debugging

Having someone else to look over your code can also greatly reduce the time spent debugging. From spotting a typo in your code, to having a suggestion based on past experience, they can save you hours of aggravation. Just having someone you can explain your problem to can also help you to find the flaws in you logic yourself. Finally, if they happen to be intimately familiar with the section of code that you are referring to, they might already have a fix in mind by the time you've asked your question.

In conclusion, I think that working on software development teams is something every software developer should experience, even if they go off to become solo contractors or consultants. While I can understand the lack of group projects in schools, as most homework projects are not ambitious enough for a team, and it can make grading difficult, they are something I think every computer science student should have experience with.
